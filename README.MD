These are my submissions for the AdventOfCode puzzles.
Most, if not all of my submissions are basically brute force attempts

I'm using this more as study and practice, rather than as an attempt to win the leaderboards.

Personally, I think the chrismas theme is really fun and am having a blast doing these puzzles.

:D
